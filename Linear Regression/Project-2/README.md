# California House Price
This Supervised learning Project
## Project Overview

This is the project that predicts the house price in California. I am going to use Linear regression model In Supervised Machine Learning.  \
## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: [California House Price](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shibumohapatra/house-price)
- **Description**: The US Census Bureau has published California Census Data which has 10 types of metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. The dataset also serves as an input for project scoping and tries to specify the functional and nonfunctional r requirements for it.
- **Features**:
- longitude (signed numeric - float) : Longitude value for the block in California, USA
- latitude (numeric - float ) : Latitude value for the block in California, USA
- housing_median_age (numeric - int ) : Median age of the house in the block
- total_rooms (numeric - int ) : Count of the total number of rooms (excluding bedrooms) in all houses in the block
- total_bedrooms (numeric - float ) : Count of the total number of bedrooms in all houses in the block
- population (numeric - int ) : Count of the total number of population in the block
- households (numeric - int ) : Count of the total number of households in the block
- median_income (numeric - float ) : Median of the total household income of all the houses in the block
- ocean_proximity (numeric - categorical ) : Type of the landscape of the block [ Unique Values : 'NEAR BAY', '<1H OCEAN', 'INLAND', 'NEAR OCEAN', 'ISLAND' ]
- median_house_value (numeric - int ) : Median of the household prices of all the houses in the block

## Methodology
**Data Exploration:** Loaded and inspected the dataset.
Explored statistical summaries and visualizations to understand data distributions. \
**Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and outliers.
Normalized or scaled features if necessary. \
**Model Training:** Split the data into training and testing sets.
Trained a Linear Regression model on the training data. \
**Model Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using R-squared score and residual analysis.
Visualized predictions versus actual values to assess model accuracy.
## Results:
Analyzed the performance of the Linear Regression model. \
Hence, We can predict the house prices
