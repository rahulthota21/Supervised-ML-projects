# E-Commerce User Preference Prediction
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether users of an e-commerce platform are more likely to use a mobile app or a website. The prediction is based on user interaction data, including time spent on the website and other relevant features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the E-Commerce Dataset from Kaggle - [E-Commerce](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website). The dataset contains user interactions with an e-commerce platform, focusing on the following key features:

Time on Website: The amount of time a user spends on the website. \
Yearly Amount Spent: The total amount spent by the user annually. \
Other Features: Additional features that may influence the user's preference.
## Objective
The primary objective is to build a predictive model using Linear Regression to determine whether a user will prefer using a mobile app or a website. The project involves:

**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
**Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for prediction.
**Model Training**: Applying Linear Regression to train the model.
**Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared score.
## Methodology
**Data Exploration:** Loaded and inspected the dataset.
Explored statistical summaries and visualizations to understand data distributions. \
**Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and outliers.
Normalized or scaled features if necessary. \
**Model Training:** Split the data into training and testing sets.
Trained a Linear Regression model on the training data. \
**Model Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using R-squared score and residual analysis.
Visualized predictions versus actual values to assess model accuracy.
## Results:
Analyzed the performance of the Linear Regression model. \
Generated insights into factors influencing user preferences for mobile apps versus websites.
